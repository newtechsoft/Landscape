            The interscalene approach to brachial plexus blockade results in anesthesia of the shoulder and upper arm. Inferior trunk for more distal anesthesia can also be blocked by additional, selective injection, deeper in the plexus.
            <p>
            This is accomplished either by controlled needle redirection inferiorly or by additional scanning to visualize the inferior trunk and another needle insertion and targeted injection. For a more comprehensive review of the brachial plexus distribution, see Chapter 1 on Essential Regional Anesthesia Anatomy.

                    Typical image of the brachial plexus (BP). The BP is seen positioned between the anterior scalene muscle (ASM) and the middle scalene muscle (MSM).
                    <p>
                    The superficial cervical plexus (white arrowhead) can be seen posterior to the SCM and underneath the prevertebral fascia. In this particular image, the vertebral artery (VA), carotid artery (CA), as well as the transverse process of C6 are also seen.
