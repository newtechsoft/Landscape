            The goal of the continuous interscalene block is similar to the non–ultrasound-based techniques: to place the catheter in the vicinity of the trunks of the brachial plexus between the scalene muscles.
            <p>The procedure consists of three phases: needle placement, catheter advancement, and securing of the catheter. For the first two phases of the procedure, ultrasound can be used to assure accuracy.
            </p>
            <p>
            The needle is typically inserted in-plane from the lateral-to-medial direction and underneath the prevertebral fascia to enter the interscalene space (Figure 29-9), although other needle directions could be used.

            Proper placement of the needle can also be confirmed by obtaining a motor response of the deltoid muscle, arm, or forearm (0.5 mA, 0.1 msec) at which point 4 to 5 mL of local anesthetic can be injected.
            <p>This small dose of local anesthetic serves to assure adequate distribution of the local anesthetic as well as to make the advancement of the catheter more comfortable to the patient.
            </p>
            <p> This first phase of the procedure does not significantly differ from the single-injection technique. The second phase of the procedure involves maintaining the needle in the proper position and inserting the catheter 2 to 3 cm into the interscalene space in the vicinity of the brachial plexus (Figure 29-10).
            </p>
            <p>
            Insertion of the catheter can be accomplished by a single operator or with a helper. Proper location of the catheter can be determined either by visualizing the course of the catheter or by an injection of the local anesthetic through the catheter. When this proves difficult, alternatively, a small amount of air (1 mL) can be injected to confirm the catheter tip location.

            There is no agreement on what constitutes the ideal catheter securing system. The catheter is secured by either taping to the skin or tunneling. Some clinicians prefer one over the other. However, the decision about which method to use could be based on the patient’s age, duration of the catheter therapy, and anatomy.
            <p>
            Tunneling could be preferred in older patients with obesity or mobile skin over the neck and when longer duration of catheter infusion is expected. Two main disadvantages of tunneling are the risk of catheter dislodgment during the tunneling and the potential for scar formation.
            </p>
            <p>
            Fortunately, a number of catheter-securing devices are available to help stabilize the catheter.
