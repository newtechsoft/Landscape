            Any position that allows comfortable placement of the ultrasound transducer and needle advancement is appropriate. The block is typically performed with the patient in supine, semisitting, or semilateral decubitus position, with the patientâ€™s head facing away from the side to be blocked.

            The latter position may prove ergonomically more convenient, especially during an in-plane approach from the lateral side, in which the needle is entering the skin at the posterolateral aspect of the neck. A slight elevation of the head of the bed is often more comfortable for the patient, and it allows for better drainage and less prominence of the neck veins.

            Adherence to strict anatomic landmarks is of lesser importance for the ultrasound-guided interscalene block than it is the case for the surface anatomy-based techniques. Regardless, knowledge of the underlying anatomy and the position of the brachial plexus is important to facilitate recognition of the ultrasound anatomy.

            Scanning usually begins just below the level of the cricoid cartilage and medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle with a goal to identify the carotid artery.

            Goal: 
            <p> The goal is to place the needle in the tissue space between the anterior and middle scalene muscles and inject local anesthetic until the spread around the brachial plexus is documented by ultrasound.
                <p>The volume of the local anesthetic and number of needle insertions are determined during the procedure and depend on the adequacy of the observed spread of the local anesthetic.
