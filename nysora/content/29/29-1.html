        Interscalene brachial plexus block is one of the most useful and most commonly used regional block techniques in clinical practice.
        </p>
        <p>
        The introduction of ultrasound has also made it much safer and more precise. Ultrasound guidance also allows for substantial reduction in volume and dose of LA to accomplish the block (5-15 ml).
        <p>
        Ability to inject multiple aliquots of local anesthetic also may allow for the reduction in the volume of local anesthetic required to accomplish the block. Repetition of the block in case of inadequate anesthesia is also possible, a management option that is unpredictable without ultrasound guidance.

        <p>
        Ultrasound monitoring also allows visualization of LA distribution to assure adequate spread pattern associated with successful block. In most instances, a single injection is adequate with very minor needle adjustments, when necessary.

        <p>
        Multiple injections of several aliquots of local anesthetic are advocated by some, however they are not only unnecessary, but also may be associated with greater risk of neurologic injury or vascular puncture. Most common indications include:

            <li>Shoulder surgery</li>
            <li>Humerus surgery</li>
            <li>Surgery on distal clavicle</li>
            <li>Artrio-venous fistulae creation</li>
            <li>Analgesia for reposition of shoulder dislocation or physical therapy for frozen shoulder</li>
