            The ultrasound-guided technique of interscalene brachial plexus block differs from nerve stimulator or landmark-based techniques in several important aspects. Most importantly, distribution of the local anesthetic is visualized to assure adequate spread around the brachial plexus. Ultrasound guidance allows multiple injections around the brachial plexus, therefore eliminating the reliance on a single large injection of local anesthetic for block success as is the case with nonâ€“ultrasound-guided techniques. Ability to inject multiple aliquots of local anesthetic also may allow for the reduction in the volume of local anesthetic required to accomplish the block. Repetition of the block in case of inadequate anesthesia is also possible, a management option that is unpredictable without ultrasound guidance. Finally, the risk of major vessel and nerve puncture during nerve block performance is reduced.
