            The brachial plexus at the interscalene level is seen lateral to the carotid artery, between the anterior and middle scalene muscles (Figures 29-2, 29-3, and 29-4). Prevertebral fascia, superficial cervical plexus and sternocleidomastoid muscle are seen superficial to the plexus. The transducer is moved in the superior-inferior direction until two or more of the bra- chial plexus trunks are seen in the space between the scalene muscles. Depending on the depth of field selected and the level at which the scanning is performed, first rib and/or apex of the lung may be seen. The brachial plexus is typically visualized at a depth of 1 to 3 cm.

                    Relevant anatomy for interscalene brachial block and transducer position to obtain the desired views. Brachial plexus (BP) is seen sandwiched between middle scalene muscle (MSM) laterally and anterior scalene muscle (ASM) medially. Ultrasound image often includes a partial view of the lateral border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) as well as the internal jugular vein (IJV) and carotid artery (CA). The transverse process of one of the cervical vertebrae is also often seen.
