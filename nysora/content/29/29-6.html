            With the patient in the proper position, the skin is disinfected and the transducer is positioned in the transverse plane to identify the carotid artery (Figure 29-5).
                <p> Once the artery is identified, the transducer is moved slightly laterally across the neck (see algorithm at end of chapter).

                The goal is to identify the scalene muscles and the brachial plexus that is sandwiched between the anterior and middle scalene muscles.

                When the visualization of the brachial plexus between the scalene muscles proves difficult, the transducer is lowered to the supraclavicular fossa.
                    <p> At this position, the brachial plexus is identified lateral and superficial to the subclavian artery, (Figure 29-6). From here, the brachial plexus is traced cranially to the desired level.

            The needle is then inserted in-plane toward the brachial plexus, typically in a lateral-to-medial direction (Figure 29-7), although medial-to-lateral needle orientation also can be chosen if more convenient. As the needle passes through the prevertebral fascia, a certain “give” is often appreciated.
            <p> When nerve stimulation is used (0.5 mA, 0.1 msec), the entrance of the needle in the interscalene groove is often associated with a motor response of the shoulder, arm, or forearm as another confirmation of the proper needle placement.

            <p>
            After a careful aspiration to rule out an intra- vascular needle placement, 1 to 2 mL of local anesthetic is injected to document the proper needle placement (Figure 29-8A). Injection of several milliliters of local anesthetic often displaces the brachial plexus away from the needle.

            An additional advancement of the needle 1 to 2 mm toward the brachial plexus may be beneficial to assure a proper spread of the local anesthetic (Figure 29-8B). Whenever the needle is further advanced, or multiple injections used, assure that high resistance to injection is absent to decrease the risk of an intrafascicular injection.

            <p>
            When injection of the local anesthetic does not appear to result in a spread around the brachial plexus, additional needle repositions and injections may be necessary.

            Tips: 
            <p>
                The presence of the motor response to nerve stimulation is useful but not necessary to elicit if the plexus, needle, and local anesthetic spread are well-visualized.
                <ul>
                    <li>The neck is a very vascular area, and care must be exercised to avoid needle placement or injection into the vascular structures. Of particular importance is to avoid the vertebral artery, and branches of the thyro- cervical trunk: inferior thyroid artery, suprascapular artery, and transverse cervical artery.
                    </li>
                    <li> Never inject against high resistance (>15 psi) because this may indicate a needle-nerve contact or an intrafascicular injection.
                    </li>
                    <li> Pro and con of multiple injections:
                                    <li>In an adult patient, 15 to 25 mL of local anesthetic is usually adequate for successful and rapid onset of blockade. Smaller volumes of local anesthetics can also be effective, however, their success rate in everyday clinical practice may be inferior to those reported in meticulously conducted clinical trials.
                                        <p>The block dynamics and perioperative management are similar to those described in Chapter 12. </p>
