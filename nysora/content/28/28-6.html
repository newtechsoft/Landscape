            With the patient in the proper position, the skin is disinfected and the transducer is placed on the lateral neck, overlying the SCM at the level of its midpoint (approximately the level of the cricoid cartilage).
            
            <p> Once the SCM is identified, the transducer is moved posteriorly until the tapering posterior edge is positioned in the middle of the screen. At this point, an attempt should be made to identify the brachial plexus and/or the interscalene groove between the anterior and middle scalene muscles.
            </p>
            <p>
            The plexus is visible as a small collection of hypoechoic nodules (honeycomb appearance) immediately underneath the prevertebral fascia that overlies the interscalene groove (Figures 28-3 and 28-4).
            </p>
            <p>Once identified, the needle is passed through the skin, platysma and prevertebral fascia, and the tip placed adjacent to the plexus (Figure 28-7). Because of the relatively shallow position of the target, both in-plane (from medial or lateral sides) and out-of-plane approaches can be used.
            </p>
            <p>Following negative aspiration, 1 to 2 mL of local anesthetic is injected to confirm the proper injection site. Then the remainder of the local anesthetic (10–15 mL) is administered to envelop the plexus (Figure 28-8).

            If the plexus is not visualized, an alternative substerno-cleidomastoid approach can be used.

            Local anesthetic (10–15 mL) is administered and should be visualized layering out between the SCM and the underlying prevertebral fascia (Figure 28-11). If injection of the local anesthetic does not appear to result in an appropriate spread, additional needle repositioning and injections may be necessary.
            
            <p>
            Because the superficial cervical plexus is made up of purely sensory nerves, high concentrations of local anesthetic are usually not required; 0.25%-0.5% ropivacaine, bupivacaine 0.25%, or lidocaine 1% are examples of good choices.

                <li> Visualization of the plexus is not necessary to perform this block because it may not be always readily apparent. Administration of 10 to 15 mL of local anesthetic deep to the SCM provides a reliable block without confirming the position of the plexus.

                The superficial cervical plexus overlies the brachial plexus (i.e., immediately superficial to the inter- scalene groove and underneath the prevertebral fascia). This can serve as a sonographic landmark by identifying the scalene muscles, the trunks of the brachial plexus, and/or the groove itself and the prevertebral fascia.
