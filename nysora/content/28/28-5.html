            Any patient position that allows for comfortable placement of the ultrasound transducer and  needle advancement is appropriate.
            <p>
            This block is typically performed in the supine or semi-sitting position, with the head turned slightly away from the side to be blocked to facilitate operator access (Figure 28-6A and B). The patientâ€™s neck and upper chest should be exposed so that the relative length and position of the SCM can be assessed.

            Goal:
            <p>
                The goal is to place the needle tip immediately adjacent to the superficial cervical plexus. If it is not easily visualized, the local anesthetic can be deposited in the plane immediately deep to the SCM and underneath the prevertebral fasica. A volume of 10 to 15 mL of local anesthetic usually suffices.
