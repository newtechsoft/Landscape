If nerve stimulation is used, a wrist or finger extension response should be elicited when the needle is in proximity to the nerve. After negative aspiration, 4–5 mL of local anesthetic is injected (Figure 33-6B). If the spread is inadequate, slight adjustments can be made and a further 2–3 mL of local anesthetic administered.

            Median and Ulnar Nerves
            With the arm abducted and the palm up, the skin of the volar forearm is disinfected and the transducer positioned transversely on the midforearm. The median nerve should be identified between the previously mentioned muscle layers.

            If it is not immediately visualized, the transducer should be positioned slightly more laterally and the radial artery identified, using color Doppler ultrasound. Sliding back to the midline, the nerve can be seen approximately 1–2 cm medial and 1 cm deep to the radial artery. The needle is inserted in- plane from either side of the transducer (Figure 33-7A). After negative aspiration, 4–5 mL of local anesthetic is injected (Figure 33-7B). If the spread is inadequate, slight adjustments can be made and a further 2–3 mL of local anesthetic administered.

            Tips:

            • The median nerve can often “hide” in the background of the musculature. Tilting the transducer proximally or distally will bring the nerve out of the background.
            • Imaging at the level of the elbow crease readily reveals the nerve positioned medial to the brachial artery. From this location, the nerve can be traced distally.
            • When in doubt, nerve stimulation(0.5-1.0mA) can be used to confirm localization of the correct nerve.
            • In some patients, the median and ulnar nerves often can both be anesthetized with a single skin puncture.

        <p class="body">
            Then the transducer is positioned more medially until the ulnar nerve is identified. The use of color Doppler ultrasound can aid in finding the ulnar artery, which always lies lateral to the nerve at this level. The nerve should then be traced up until the artery “splits off,” to minimize the likelihood of arterial puncture. The needle is inserted in-plane from either side of the transducer (the lateral side is often more ergo- nomic) (Figure 33-8A). After negative aspiration, 4–5 mL of local anesthetic is injected (Figure 33-8B). If the spread of

            the local anesthetic is inadequate, slight adjustments can be made and a further 2–3 mL administered. The use of a tourniquet, either on the arm or forearm, usually requires sedation and/or additional analgesia.

            Tips:
            • The out-of-plane approach can also be used for all three blocks; however, we find that visualizing the needle path makes for greater consistency in placement and a lesser chance of nerve impalement.
