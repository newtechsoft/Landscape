            Equipment needed includes the following:
			• Ultrasound machine with linear transducer (8–14 MHz), sterile sleeve, and gel
			• Standard nerve block tray
			• One 20-mL syringe containing local anesthetic
			• A 2-in, 22–25 gauge short-bevel insulated stimulating needle
			• Peripheral nerve stimulator (optional)
			• Sterile gloves

            Tip:
            Because these are superficial blocks of distal peripheral nerves, some practitioners choose to use a small-gauge (i.e., 25-gauge) needle. When a using small-gauge needle, however, meticulous attention should be paid to avoid an intraneural injection, which is more likely with a smaller diameter and sharp tip design.
