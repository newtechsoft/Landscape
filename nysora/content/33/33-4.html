            Equipment needed includes the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Ultrasound machine with linear transducer (8–14 MHz), sterile sleeve, and gel</li>
                <li>Standard nerve block tray</li>
                <li>One 20-mL syringe containing local anesthetic</li>
                <li>A 2-in, 22–25 gauge short-bevel insulated stimulating needle</li>
                <li>Peripheral nerve stimulator (optional)</li>
                <li>Sterile gloves</li>

            Tip:
            <p>
            Because these are superficial blocks of distal peripheral nerves, some practitioners choose to use a small-gauge (i.e., 25-gauge) needle.
            </p>
            <p>
            When a using small-gauge needle, however, meticulous attention should be paid to avoid an intraneural injection, which is more likely with a smaller diameter and sharp tip design.
