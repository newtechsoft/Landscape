            Any patient position that allows for comfortable placement of the ultrasound transducer and needle advancement is appropriate.

            Typically, the block is performed with the patient in the supine position. For the radial nerve block, the arm is flexed at the elbow and the hand is placed on the patient’s abdomen (Figure 33-1A).

            <p>
            This position allows for the most practical application of the transducer. The median and ulnar nerves are blocked with the arm abducted and placed on an armboard, palm facing up. (Figures 33-1 B,C)

            Goal:
            <p>
            The goal is to place the needle tip immediately adjacent to the nerve(s) of choice and to deposit 4–5 mL of local anesthetic in the vicinity of the nerve.
            </p>
            <p>
            It is unnecessary to completely surround the entire nerve in a doughnut pattern, although this can enhance the speed of onset of the block. As with all peripheral blocks, avoidance of resistance to injection is important to decrease the risk of an intrafascicular injection.
